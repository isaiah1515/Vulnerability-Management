# Vulnerability-Management
Conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans. Then remediated and verified vulnerabilities while documenting them for realistic scenarios

## Introduction

In this project, a secure Azure network was established with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. A vulnerable Windows 10 VM was created, intentionally configured with outdated software and disabled security controls. Comprehensive vulnerability scans were conducted using OpenVAS, both unauthenticated and credentialed. The results were analyzed, emphasizing distinctions between unauthenticated and credentialed scans. Identified vulnerabilities were effectively remediated and confirmed through subsequent scans. Furthermore, a catalog of remediable vulnerabilities was compiled to replicate real-world vulnerability remediation scenarios.

Steps Taken
- Create our Free Azure Account
- Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner
- Create Client Virtual Machine and Make it Vulnerable
- Perform Unauthenticated Scan
- Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (Within VM)
- Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (OpenVAS)
- Perform Authenticated Scan against our Vulnerable Windows VM
- Remediate Vulnerabilities
- Verify Remediations



## Conclusion

In this lab, a honeynet was built in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel then ingested the logs from a central repository which provided alerts, triggers and created incidents based off the data. After hardening the environment itâ€™s clear that the number of security events has reduced significantly. This project was a perfect hands-on learning experience to help better understand a real-world SOC environment.

*Please note that it is more than likely that more security events, alerts, and incidents would have been generated in a larger, enterprise environment.
