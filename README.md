## Introduction

In this project, a secure Azure network was established with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. A vulnerable Windows 10 VM was created, intentionally configured with outdated software and disabled security controls. Comprehensive vulnerability scans were conducted using OpenVAS, both unauthenticated and credentialed. The results were analyzed, emphasizing distinctions between unauthenticated and credentialed scans. Identified vulnerabilities were effectively remediated and confirmed through subsequent scans. Furthermore, a catalog of remediable vulnerabilities was compiled to replicate real-world vulnerability remediation scenarios.


## Steps Taken
- Create our Free Azure Account
- Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner
- Create Client Virtual Machine and Make it Vulnerable

- Perform Unauthenticated Scan
- Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (Within VM)
- Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (OpenVAS)
- Perform Authenticated Scan against our Vulnerable Windows VM
- Remediate Vulnerabilities
- Verify Remediations



## Conclusion

The primary goal of this lab is to leverage OpenVAS for the detection of vulnerabilities on a Windows system and subsequently apply remediation measures to enhance the security of the client system.
